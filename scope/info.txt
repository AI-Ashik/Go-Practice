// Scope?
// -> The boundaries of elements in a program.

// If something declared out side of main function, its filled in global area. It can be access from anywhere.

// There are 3 times of scopes:
// Global Scope: Variables declared outside any function or block, accessible throughout the package and other packages if exported (capitalized).

// Local Scope: includes variables declared inside functions and inside blocks (curly braces). Variables in blocks are only accessible within those blocks.

// Package Scope: Variables declared outside functions but inside a package (not exported), accessible anywhere within the same package.
